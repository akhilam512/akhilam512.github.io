Serendipity in the real-life comes at a premium. You have to be at the right place, at the right time to strike gold. You will need to jump over loops, be able to get favours, tackle people and conversations to get what you want - and in the end, this would just get you a conversation for 1-2 minutes with someone important. 
The fancy term for this is “warm introductions”.

Serendipity in the remote world, in comparison, is straightforward. 
Nothing beats warm introductions though but here, you are “only” an email away from a potential investor, a mentor, or a customer. 
Of course, you still need a solid strategy and perhaps a lot more luck but writing ‘cold’ emails is an art in itself.

--------

Let me give you two personal examples each of cold emails that worked and one that didn’t. 
The emails went to two of my favourite startup people.

Your cold emails should take you a lot of time to write and that is good. Each email has its own characteristics depending on whom you are sending it to  i.e. if your motive is to build a long term relationship.

The person reading on the other side should feel that you have done your homework and you are not someone who is just sending the same mail to a lot of people and expecting to get a response.

At its heart, it's just talking your heart out - nothing else. No fancy salesmanship or trying to impress. 

The best cold emails are honest, actionable, and waste no time for the reader. 

There is no fluff nor beating around the bush and ideally, it wouldn’t even cross 2 or 3 paragraphs.

For my first mail that worked, it started with an incredibly personal and heartfelt message. I had been following this person's content for last 5-6 years or so. He has had an impact on my viewpoint of the world much more than any other figure at the time and I believe it was his answers that sowed the seeds for entrepreneurship early on.

The best cold emails you will write will be automatically for the people who you believe the most in,- you will be at the most genuine, honest version of yourself  - just like how water flows inevitably through a bed of rocks - this works almost always.

Watch the subject line, it is eye-catching. From his perspective, it’s relatable. The receiver in this case is a popular writer on Quora and as described in one of his answers, at one point, he was a 'young follower' himself. The rest of the email described my startup where I asked him for his feedback.
This worked and he responded.

Also, note that the platform you use matters a lot. Use the platform where the receiver is less likely to be bombarded by random strangers / where the receiver has a lot of followers. For this guy, the worst place to send him the mail where he had the most followers.

For the one that didn’t work - the principles remained the same but I focused too much on “getting help” rather than “connecting” - it started with this:

And this was at the end:

Reading it now, it just feels like a cooked up half-assed effort to get some feedback.

Key takeaways:
- Connect with the person on a deeper level to whom you are sending to. Read their tweets, read all of their blog posts, see what they have built. Come to appreciate a thing or two about the person whom you are sending it to - you can’t write well if you don’t feel it.
- Be genuine & expect nothing and no, not even a response. Sounds counter-intuitive, but it works :) I’m not saying don’t ask for help, ask for help - but at the same time, you should be okay without their help as well. Try your best.
- Mind the platform. Use the platform which the person expects something important to come through. You could also try multiple times but don’t spam.
- Make sure your content is actionable and your email/message will be opened from its first line/subject. If you ask for too much, the person might just think “Okay, I will do this later” and you end up never getting a response. Instead ask for something quick and sweet, and from there you can build a conversation.
