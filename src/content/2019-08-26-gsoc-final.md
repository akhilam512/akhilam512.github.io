GSoC period is officially over and here is a final report of my work in the past 3 months -

https://community.kde.org/GSoC/2019/StatusReports/AkhilKGangadharan

The whole experience - for the last 8 months -  right from the first patch to the titler project,  has been great with a steep learning curve and I have thoroughly enjoyed the whole process. I seek to continue improving Kdenlive and I'm really thankful to all the Kdenlive developers and the community for presenting me with this fine opportunity to work for the revamp of an important feature in our beloved editor.

The new titler - as a project in whole, is far from over - and I will continue my work with the titler so nothing really changes, although GSoC is 'officially' over ;)

The next update will be when we get a working backend set up - until then!
