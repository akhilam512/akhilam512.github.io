Heck, they do that now, after a college degree, most of the companies have a “training period” where they “educate” them about how stuff works in the industry. Why take all that pain? Just roll out your own course online, let them learn what they need and then choose from the best.</p>\n<p>Why should someone take a lifetime worth of debt?\nWhy should someone spend years just to get entry into a ‘prestigious’ university?</p>\n<p>College education is going to be redefined. It might take a decade or two but change is coming.</p>","excerpt":"COVID-19 has forced us to adopt new ways in a lot of areas of our daily lives - work, communication, education - every sphere of our lives has been changed and…","frontmatter":{"date":"04 August, 2020","path":"/blog/college-ed","title":"The future of college education"},"fields":{"readingTime":{"text":"2 min read"}}}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
