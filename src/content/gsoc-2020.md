This year, I participated in the Google Summer of Code as a [mentor](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2020/projects/6615488269910016/) for [KDE/Kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org/en/).

Sashmita Raghav was selected this year to work on providing a basic subtitling support in Kdenlive.

This year was different - COVID-19, as well all know, shook the world. GSoC had its timeline shifted by a month or so. Sashmita was able to meet almost all of the goals for her project. You can view the final report [here](https://community.kde.org/GSoC/2020/StatusReports/SashmitaRaghav). 

On a personal level, it was quite a journey to transition [from a student last year](/blog/gsoc-19) to a mentor. Being able to provide insight and guide was quite an experience. Many thanks to my mentors at the Kdenlive team and the entire KDE Community for giving me this chance.


*UPDATE:*

Sashmita's work was merged a couple of months later, and now you can use the subtitler tool to create and edit subtitles from [Kdenlive 20.12](https://kdenlive.org/en/2020/12/kdenlive-20-12-is-out/)!
